# docker-google-drive-backup
Docker container for Backup creation and uploading to Google drive. The core API for the authentikation s made and hosted by the Creator of the [Hass.io](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup) Addon. The UI is also used but the backend needed to be remade from scratch to funktion without Home Assistant. If you like either one of the projects plese donate to the original Creator.
